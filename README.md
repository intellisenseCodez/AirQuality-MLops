## Project Overview

This End-to-End Air Quality MLOps Project is designed to collect, process, and analyze air quality data using a fully automated ML pipeline. The project integrates MLOps best practices to enable:

- Data ingestion from APIs and external sources.

- Feature engineering and transformation for ML modeling.

- Model training & evaluation using machine learning algorithms.

- Deployment & monitoring of models using MLOps workflows.

The goal is to predict air quality levels based on historical and real-time data, ensuring accurate and efficient air pollution forecasting.

## Data Pipeline

The air quality data pipeline includes the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Scraping real-time air quality data from APIs.

2. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Handling missing values, normalizing data.

3. Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features for model training.

4. Data Storage: Saving processed data in the transformed_data directory.

## Model Training & Evaluation

- Utilized machine learning models for air quality prediction.

- Evaluated performance using confusion matrices and correlation heatmaps.

- Model artifacts are stored in the models/ directory.

## MLOps Implementation

1. Version Control: Managed using GitHub.

2. CI/CD Pipelines: Automates model training, validation, and deployment.

3. Monitoring & Logging: Tracks model performance over time.
